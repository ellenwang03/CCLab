  <h1>Mirror Superstition</h1>
  <div class="text">
    <div class="description">
      <p>Breaking a mirror would bring you seven years of bad luck, dating back to the ancient Romans. They believed life was renewed every seven years, which explains the length of the curse. However, there are certain steps you should follow if you break a mirror to dispose of it safely, such as burying the pieces in the ground, washing it away with water and burning it.
